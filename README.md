## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project will implement several key features that replicate the core functionality of the Airbnb platform. Each feature plays a crucial role in creating a complete and user-friendly application.

### 1. User Management
Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature includes role management (guest, host, admin) and secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific parts of the system.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as location, price, descript

### ðŸ”— Relationships
- A **User** can be a **Host** (owning multiple properties) or a **Guest** (making multiple bookings).  
- A **Property** belongs to a **Host** and can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to a **User** and a **Property**, and it generates a **Payment**.  
- A **Review** is created by a **User** for a specific **Property** after a booking.  
- A **Payment** is linked to a single **Booking**.  

## API Security

To ensure the Airbnb Clone Project is safe, reliable, and trustworthy, several key security measures will be implemented. Security is critical for protecting user data, transactions, and the integrity of the platform.

### 1. Authentication
**Description:** Verifies the identity of users before granting access to the system, typically through secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth).  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information such as accounts, bookings, and payments.

### 2. Authorization
**Description:** Determines what resources a user can access based on their role (e.g., guest, host, admin).  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Ensures that users can only perform actions permitted to their role (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only admins can manage the platform).

### 3. Data Encryption
**Description:** Uses encryption (e.g., HTTPS/TLS, hashing passwords with bcrypt) to secure sensitive data in transit and at rest.  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Protects user credentials, payment details, and personal information from being stolen during communication or database breaches.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
**Description:** Limits the number of requests a client can make to the API in a given time frame.  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Prevents abuse, brute-force login attempts, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
**Description:** Ensures that all input (e.g., form data, search queries) is properly validated and sanitized.  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Prevents common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection flaws.

### 6. Secure Payments
**Description:** Integrates trusted payment gateways with strong security standards (e.g., PCI-DSS compliance).  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Protects usersâ€™ financial information and prevents fraudulent transactions.

### 7. Logging & Monitoring
**Description:** Keeps track of API requests and suspicious activities for auditing and quick response.  
**Why itâ€™s important:** Helps detect security breaches early and maintain accountability.  
## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment**.  
It is a set of practices that automate the process of testing, integrating, and deploying code changes.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers frequently merge their code into a shared repository where automated builds and tests run.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Approved changes are automatically deployed to staging or production environments.

### Why itâ€™s Important
- **Faster Development:** Ensures new features and bug fixes are delivered quickly.  
- **Reduced Errors:** Automated testing catches issues early before they reach production.  
- **Consistency:** Provides a repeatable and reliable deployment process.  
- **Collaboration:** Encourages teamwork by allowing multiple developers to work together seamlessly.  

### Tools for CI/CD in This Project
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows such as running tests, linting code, and deploying the app after each commit.  
- **Docker:** Provides containerization to ensure the app runs the same way across different environments (development, testing, production).  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean (Deployment options):** Cloud platforms that can be used to host and scale the application.  
- **Pytest / Jest (Testing tools):** Ensures backend and frontend code is tested before deployment.  

### Summary
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in this project guarantees that every change goes through an automated process of **building â†’ testing â†’ deploying**, resulting in a more secure, stable, and professional product.  n
