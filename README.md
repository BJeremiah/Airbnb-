# Airbnb-
A clone of the AirBnB platform built for learning full-stack development.
# Airbnb Clone Project  

## Overview  
This project is a simplified clone of Airbnb, built as part of a learning exercise.  
The goal is to understand how full-stack applications are structured and developed.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React if needed)  
- **Backend**: Python/Flask or Node.js/Express  
- **Database**: MySQL or MongoDB  

## Goals  
- Build a functional user interface similar to Airbnb  
- Implement user authentication (signup/login)  
- Add booking and listing features  
- Practice full-stack deployment  
## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer  
Responsible for building the server-side of the application. They handle business logic, user authentication, and integration with the database and frontend.  

### 2. Frontend Developer  
Focuses on the user interface and user experience. They ensure the website is visually appealing, interactive, and communicates smoothly with the backend.  

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)  
Manages the project’s database. Responsible for designing database schemas, optimizing queries, ensuring data security, and performing backups.  

### 4. Project Manager  
Oversees the project’s progress, coordinates tasks among team members, ensures deadlines are met, and facilitates communication within the team.  

### 5. QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)  
Tests the system to ensure that features work as intended. Identifies bugs, documents issues, and verifies that fixes meet quality standards.  

### 6. UI/UX Designer  
Designs the look and feel of the platform. Creates wireframes, mockups, and ensures that the application is intuitive and user-friendly.  

### 7. DevOps Engineer  
Handles deployment, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), server setup, and ensures the app runs smoothly in production.  
## Technology Stack

### 1. Django  
A high-level Python web framework used for building robust and scalable web applications. In this project, Django provides the server-side logic and manages the connection between frontend, backend, and database.

### 2. PostgreSQL  
An advanced open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL stores and manages all project data such as user accounts, listings, bookings, and reviews.

### 3. GraphQL  
A query language and runtime for APIs. It allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs from the backend, making data fetching more efficient compared to traditional REST APIs.

### 4. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
The core building blocks for the frontend of the application.  
- **HTML**: Structures the web pages.  
- **CSS**: Styles the web pages for a clean and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic features.  

### 5. React (Optional Enhancement)  
A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React could be used to create reusable components and a smoother, faster user experience.

### 6. Git & GitHub  
- **Git**: Version control system used to track changes in code.  
- **GitHub**: A platform for hosting the repository, enabling collaboration and code sharing.  

### 7. Docker (Optional Enhancement)  
A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments during development and deployment.  

### 8. CI/CD Tools (e.g., GitHub Actions)  
Used to automate testing, integration, and deployment so that new changes can be released faster and with fewer errors.
